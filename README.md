# MogKit

MogKit is a toolkit that makes heavy use of _Transducers_ in order to create composable transformations that are independent from the underlying context they are working on.

For an introduction to transducers, see [Clojure - Transducers](http://clojure.org/transducers) and the presentation by Clojure creator [Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTbuzafcII).

## Example
...

## Installation
The easiest way is to install through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Simply add

```
github "mhallendal/MogKit" "master"
```

to your `Cartfile` and follow the Carthage instructions for including the framework in your application.

You can also add it as submodule to your project `https://github.com/mhallendal/MogKit.git` and include the project file in your application.

If you are using the Foundation extensions, like `-mog_transduce:` on `NSArray`, make suer that you add `-ObjC` to your applications _Other Linker Flags_.

CocoaPods support is planned.

## Swift support?
It's coming.
